     Solve 5 – 3x 5x + 2. in interval notation as an inequality

To solve the inequality 5 - 3x < 5x + 2, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: Move all the x terms to one side of the inequality. In this case, we can add 3x and subtract 2 from both sides to eliminate the x terms on the right-hand side:

5 - 3x + 3x - 2 < 5x + 2 + 3x - 2

3 < 8x

Step 2: Divide both sides by the coefficient of x, which is 8. Since we are dividing by a positive number, the direction of the inequality remains the same:

3/8 < x

Step 3: Write the inequality in interval notation. Since x is greater than 3/8, we can write the solution in interval notation as:

x > 3/8

So, the solution to the inequality 5 - 3x < 5x + 2 in interval notation is (3/8, ∞), which represents all real numbers greater than 3/8.
