To find the arc length of the curve defined by the equation y = ln(cos x) from (0, 0) to (π/3, -ln 2), we can use the arc length formula:

L = ∫[a, b] √[1 + (dy/dx)^2] dx

where a and b are the limits of integration, and dy/dx represents the derivative of y with respect to x.

First, let's find dy/dx by taking the derivative of y = ln(cos x) using the chain rule:

dy/dx = (1/cos x) * (-sin x)

Next, let's substitute dy/dx and the given limits of integration into the arc length formula:

L = ∫[0, π/3] √[1 + ((1/cos x) * (-sin x))^2] dx

L = ∫[0, π/3] √[1 + sin^2(x)/cos^2(x)] dx

L = ∫[0, π/3] √[(cos^2(x) + sin^2(x))/cos^2(x)] dx (using trigonometric identity cos^2(x) + sin^2(x) = 1)

L = ∫[0, π/3] √[1/cos^2(x)] dx

L = ∫[0, π/3] sec(x) dx

Now, we can integrate sec(x) with respect to x:

L = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C (where C is the constant of integration)

Finally, we can evaluate the definite integral from 0 to π/3 and substitute the given limits of integration:

L = ln|sec(π/3) + tan(π/3)| - ln|sec(0) + tan(0)|

L = ln|2 + √3| - ln|1|

L = ln|2 + √3|

So, the arc length of the curve y = ln(cos x) from (0, 0) to (π/3, -ln 2) is ln|2 + √3| units.
