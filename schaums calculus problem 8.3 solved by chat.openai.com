8.3     Using the Δ-definition, find the derivative f′(x) of the function f(x) = 2x^2 – 3x + 5.

Sure! Using the Δ-definition of a derivative, we have:

f'(x) = lim(Δx→0) (f(x + Δx) - f(x)) / Δx

Let's plug in the given function f(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 5 into this definition and simplify:

f(x + Δx) = 2(x + Δx)^2 - 3(x + Δx) + 5
= 2(x^2 + 2xΔx + Δx^2) - 3x - 3Δx + 5
= 2x^2 + 4xΔx + 2Δx^2 - 3x - 3Δx + 5

Now we can substitute f(x + Δx) and f(x) into the Δ-definition of the derivative:

f'(x) = lim(Δx→0) ((2x^2 + 4xΔx + 2Δx^2 - 3x - 3Δx + 5) - (2x^2 - 3x + 5)) / Δx

Next, we can simplify the numerator by canceling out like terms:

f'(x) = lim(Δx→0) (4xΔx + 2Δx^2 - 3Δx) / Δx

Now we can factor out Δx from the numerator:

f'(x) = lim(Δx→0) Δx(4x + 2Δx - 3) / Δx

Notice that we can cancel out Δx in the numerator and denominator since Δx approaches 0:

f'(x) = lim(Δx→0) 4x + 2Δx - 3

Finally, we can take the limit as Δx approaches 0:

f'(x) = 4x - 3

So, the derivative of the given function f(x) = 2x^2 - 3x + 5, using the Δ-definition, is f'(x) = 4x - 3.
