To find the critical numbers of the function f(x) = x(x - 1)^3, we need to first find the derivative of the function and then solve for values of x where the derivative is equal to zero or undefined.

Step 1: Find the derivative of f(x)
Using the product rule, we can find the derivative of f(x) as follows:

f'(x) = x' * (x - 1)^3 + x * [(x - 1)^3]'
= (1) * (x - 1)^3 + x * 3(x - 1)^2 * (1)
= (x - 1)^3 + 3x(x - 1)^2

Step 2: Set f'(x) = 0 and solve for x
Setting f'(x) = 0, we get:

(x - 1)^3 + 3x(x - 1)^2 = 0

We can factor out (x - 1)^2 from the equation:

(x - 1)^2[(x - 1) + 3x] = 0

This gives us two possible solutions:

x - 1 = 0 => x = 1 (Critical number)
(x - 1) + 3x = 0 => 4x - 1 = 0 => x = 1/4 (Critical number)

So, the critical numbers of f(x) are x = 1 and x = 1/4.

Step 3: Determine whether the critical numbers yield relative maxima, relative minima, or inflection points
To determine whether the critical numbers yield relative maxima, relative minima, or inflection points, we can use the second derivative test.

Taking the derivative of f'(x), we get:

f''(x) = 6(x - 1)^2 + 6x(x - 1) + 3(x - 1)^2

Setting f''(x) = 0 and solving for x, we get:

6(x - 1)^2 + 6x(x - 1) + 3(x - 1)^2 = 0

Simplifying, we get:

9(x - 1)^2 + 6x(x - 1) = 0
(x - 1)[9(x - 1) + 6x] = 0
(x - 1)(15x - 9) = 0

This gives us two possible solutions:

x - 1 = 0 => x = 1 (Critical number)
15x - 9 = 0 => 15x = 9 => x = 9/15 = 3/5 (Critical number)

So, the critical numbers of f(x) from the second derivative test are x = 1 and x = 3/5.

Now, we can classify the critical numbers:

    For x = 1: From the first derivative test, we know that f'(x) changes sign from negative to positive at x = 1. Also, from the second derivative test, we know that f''(x) is positive at x = 1. Therefore, x = 1 yields a relative minimum for f(x).

    For x = 1/4: From the first derivative test, we know that f'(x) changes sign from negative to positive at x = 1/4. Also, from the second derivative test, we know that f''(x) is positive at x = 1/4. Therefore, x = 1/4 yields a relative minimum for f(x).
