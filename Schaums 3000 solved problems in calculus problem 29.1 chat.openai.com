  Find ∫ cos2 ax dx.     latex output

Sure! Here's the integration of cos^2(ax) with respect to x:

∫ cos^2(ax) dx

We can use the trigonometric identity cos^2(x) = (1/2)(1 + cos(2x)) to rewrite the integrand:

∫ cos^2(ax) dx = ∫ (1/2)(1 + cos(2ax)) dx

Now we can split the integral into two separate integrals:

∫ (1/2)(1 + cos(2ax)) dx = (1/2) ∫ (1 + cos(2ax)) dx

Using the power rule for integration, we can integrate each term separately:

= (1/2) [ ∫ 1 dx + ∫ cos(2ax) dx ]

The integral of 1 with respect to x is simply x, and the integral of cos(2ax) with respect to x is (1/2a) sin(2ax) (by applying the chain rule). So, we can substitute these back into the expression:

= (1/2) [ x + (1/2a) sin(2ax) ] + C

where C is the constant of integration.

So, the final result is:

∫ cos^2(ax) dx = (1/2) [ x + (1/2a) sin(2ax) ] + C


The solution provided is correct. However, one possible critique is that it could be simplified further using the double angle formula for sine:

∫ cos^2(ax) dx = (1/2) [ x + (1/2a) sin(2ax) ] + C

Using the double angle formula sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x), we can rewrite sin(2ax) as 2sin(ax)cos(ax):

= (1/2) [ x + (1/2a) (2sin(ax)cos(ax)) ] + C

= (1/2) [ x + (1/a) sin(ax)cos(ax) ] + C

So, another possible solution would be:

∫ cos^2(ax) dx = (1/2) [ x + (1/a) sin(ax)cos(ax) ] + C

Both solutions are equivalent and correct, but the second one is simpler and might be preferred in some contexts.
