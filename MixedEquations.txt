mix two randomly selected mathematical equations together until a new useful equation is arrived at.

As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to generate truly random equations. However, I can provide you with a fusion of two well-known equations and demonstrate how they can be combined to create a new and potentially useful equation.

Let's take the equation for the area of a circle, A = πr², and the Pythagorean theorem, a² + b² = c². Here, 'A' represents the area of the circle, 'r' is the radius, and 'a', 'b', and 'c' are the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle.

First, we can isolate 'r' in the area equation:

r² = A/π
r = sqrt(A/π)

Next, we can replace one of the variables in the Pythagorean theorem with the expression we got for the radius:

a² + (sqrt(A/π))² = c²

Now, we have a new equation that connects the area of a circle with the side lengths of a right-angled triangle:

a² + A/π = c²

This new equation can be useful in scenarios where you have the area of a circle and the lengths of two sides of a right-angled triangle, and you wish to find the length of the third side. It might not have an obvious direct application in real-world problems, but it is an example of how two unrelated mathematical equations can be combined to create a new equation.
