Hyperbolic PDE's  and Nonlineaer  Evolution. Worked examples

Hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) describe phenomena that involve wave propagation and can model many problems in physics and engineering. Nonlinear evolution equations describe the time evolution of a system where the rates of change are not constant, usually involving nonlinear terms.

Below are two examples, one involving a hyperbolic PDE and the other a nonlinear evolution equation:

    Hyperbolic PDE - The 1D wave equation:
    The 1D wave equation is a canonical example of a hyperbolic PDE, given by:

∂^2u/∂t^2 = c^2 ∂^2u/∂x^2

where u(x,t) is a scalar function representing the wave amplitude at position x and time t, and c is the constant propagation speed.

Problem: Solve the 1D wave equation with the initial conditions u(x,0) = sin(x) and ∂u/∂t(x,0) = 0, for 0 <= x <= 2π.

Solution:
In this case, we can use the method of separation of variables. Assume a solution in the form of:

u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)

Plug the ansatz into the PDE and divide by u(x,t):

X''(x)T(t) = c^2 X(x)T''(t)

Separate variables by dividing through by X(x)T(t):

(X''(x) / X(x)) = c^2 (T''(t) / T(t))

Since the LHS depends only on x and the RHS depends only on t, both sides must be equal to a constant, say -λ:

X''(x) / X(x) = -λ = c^2 T''(t) / T(t)

Now, we have two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):

X''(x) + λX(x) = 0
T''(t) + (λ/c^2)T(t) = 0

Solving the ODE for X(x), we obtain a solution:

X(x) = A sin(√λ x) + B cos(√λ x)

Applying the initial condition u(x,0) = sin(x):

sin(x) = X(x)T(0) = (A sin(√λ x) + B cos(√λ x))T(0)

Setting λ = 1, we obtain X(x) = sin(x), which is the fundamental solution. Therefore:

u(x,t) = sin(x) T(t)

Plugging this into the second ODE:

T''(t) + (1/c^2)T(t) = 0

The general solution for T(t) is:

T(t) = C cos(t/c) + D sin(t/c)

Using the initial condition ∂u/∂t(x,0) = 0:

0 = (D sin(t/c))' = -D sin(x)/c

Thus, D = 0 and we have:

T(t) = C cos(t/c)

Our final solution for u(x,t) is:

u(x,t) = sin(x) cos(t/c)

    Nonlinear Evolution - The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) Equation:
    The KdV equation is a nonlinear evolution equation that models the propagation of waves in shallow water:

∂u/∂t + 6u ∂u/∂x + ∂^3u/∂x^3 = 0

We can demonstrate a solution method for the KdV equation using a simple example.

Nonlinear Evolution - The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) Equation

The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation that describes the propagation of waves in certain physical systems, such as shallow water waves and long waves in dispersive media. It is one of the most famous and well-studied equations in the field of soliton theory and integrable systems.

The KdV equation is given by:

∂u/∂t + 6u(∂u/∂x) + ∂³u/∂x³ = 0

Here, u = u(x,t) represents the wave amplitude as a function of position (x) and time (t).

The KdV equation is nonlinear due to the presence of the term 6u(∂u/∂x), which represents the interaction between waves. The equation also exhibits dispersive properties due to the presence of the term ∂³u/∂x³, which represents the dispersion of waves.

The KdV equation was first derived by Diederik Korteweg and Gustav de Vries in 1895 to describe the propagation of long waves in shallow water. The remarkable feature of this equation is that it can be exactly solved by using the inverse scattering transform, a powerful technique introduced by Gardner, Greene, Kruskal, and Miura in 1967.

The KdV equation supports the existence of solitons, which are localized wave packets that maintain their shape and propagate without dispersion or deformation. Solitons are a unique property of certain nonlinear systems, and they were first observed in the KdV equation by Norman Zabusky and Martin Kruskal in 1965. The existence of solitons in the KdV equation is a result of a delicate balance between nonlinearity and dispersion.

Due to its integrability and soliton solutions, the KdV equation has become a canonical model in the study of nonlinear waves, and has been extended and generalized to various other physical systems, such as plasma physics, nonlinear optics, and fluid dynamics.

one soliton example solved by numerical methods with worked example

A soliton is a self-reinforcing solitary wave packet that maintains its shape while it propagates at a constant velocity. Solitons can be found in various physical systems, such as water waves, optical fibers, and plasmas. The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation is a well-known model describing soliton behavior in these systems.

Consider the KdV equation:

∂u/∂t + 6u∂u/∂x + ∂³u/∂x³ = 0

Here, u(x,t) is the soliton wave function, and the equation represents the propagation of the soliton wave in one-dimensional space. We'll solve this equation numerically for an initial condition:

u(x,0) = -2a²sech²(ax)

with a = 1.

    Discretize the spatial domain:
    Choose the spatial domain, for example, x ∈ [-10, 10] and define the grid points N. Let N = 100, then the grid spacing ∆x = (10 - (-10)) / 100 = 0.2.

    Discretize the time domain:
    Choose the time domain, for example, t ∈ [0, 5] and define the time steps M. Let M = 250, then the time step ∆t = 5 / 250 = 0.02.

    Approximate the spatial derivatives with finite differences:
    Approximate the first and third spatial derivatives using the central difference method. For instance:

∂u/∂x ≈ (u(x+∆x,t) - u(x-∆x,t)) / (2∆x)
∂³u/∂x³ ≈ (u(x+3∆x,t) - 3u(x+2∆x,t) + 3u(x+∆x,t) - u(x-∆x,t)) / (8∆x³)

    Implement a time-stepping method:
    Use a method like the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method to advance the solution in time.

    Set the initial condition and boundary conditions:
    Initialize u(x,0) with the given initial condition and apply appropriate boundary conditions (e.g., periodic).

    Perform the time integration:
    Integrate the KdV equation in time, updating the solution u(x,t) at each time step using the finite difference approximations and the RK4 method.

After implementing these steps and executing the time integration, you will obtain a numerical solution for the KdV equation, showing the propagation of the soliton wave over the specified time period.

It is essential to note that these numerical methods have inherent errors and instabilities, and proper choice of parameters (∆x, ∆t, N, M) is crucial for obtaining accurate results. You may need to experiment with different values to find an optimal balance between accuracy and computation time.
