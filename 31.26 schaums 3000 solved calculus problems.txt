Sure! Let's verify and critique the answer using trigonometric integration method.
Given the region bounded by y = sin(x), y = 0, from x = 0 to x = π, we need to find the area of this region using integration.
Step 1: Find the points of intersection
First, let's find the points of intersection between y = sin(x) and y = 0. Setting y = sin(x) to 0, we get:
0 = sin(x)
This occurs at x = 0, x = π, and x = 2π, but we are only interested in the interval from x = 0 to x = π, as given in the problem statement.
Step 2: Set up the integral
The area of the region can be found by integrating the difference between the two functions y = sin(x) and y = 0 with respect to x over the interval [0, π]. So the integral to be evaluated is:
∫[0, π] (sin(x) - 0) dx
Step 3: Evaluate the integral
Integrating sin(x) with respect to x, we get:
∫[0, π] sin(x) dx = [-cos(x)] from 0 to π
Plugging in the limits of integration:
[-cos(π)] - [-cos(0)]
Since cos(π) = -1 and cos(0) = 1, we get:
-(-1) - 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
So, the area of the region bounded by y = sin(x), y = 0, from x = 0 to x = π is 2 square units.
Critique:
The answer obtained using trigonometric integration method is correct. The area of the region bounded by y = sin(x), y = 0, from x = 0 to x = π is indeed 2 square units. The method used to find the points of intersection, set up the integral, and evaluate the integral is accurate. However, it's important to note that the integral of sin(x) can also be evaluated using basic antiderivative rules, which might be more straightforward in this case.
