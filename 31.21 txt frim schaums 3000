Problem 31.21 from Schaums 3000 Solved Problems in Calculus.
  A 100-ft cable weighing 5 lb/ft supports a safe weighing 500 lb. Find the work done in winding 80 ft of the cable on a drum, using integral calculus, then critique your response

To find the work done in winding 80 ft of the cable on a drum, we can set up an integral to calculate the total work required to lift the cable.

First, let's calculate the weight of the 80 ft of cable. The weight of the cable is given as 5 lb/ft, so the total weight of 80 ft of cable is:

Weight of 80 ft of cable = 5 lb/ft * 80 ft = 400 lb

Next, we need to find the height the cable is lifted, which is the length of cable wound on the drum. Since the drum winds the cable, the height the cable is lifted is half of the length wound on the drum, because the cable is wound in a helical shape. Therefore, the height the cable is lifted is:

Height = 80 ft / 2 = 40 ft

Now, we can set up the integral to calculate the work done. The work done is given by the formula:

Work = ∫(Weight * height) dx

where the limits of integration are from 0 to 80 ft, and the weight and height are functions of x, the length of cable wound on the drum.

Substituting the weight and height we calculated earlier into the integral, we get:

Work = ∫(400 lb * x/2) dx

Integrating with respect to x, we get:

Work = 200 lb * x^2 / 2 | from 0 to 80

Plugging in the limits of integration, we get:

Work = (200 lb * (80)^2 / 2) - (200 lb * (0)^2 / 2)

Work = 640,000 lb-ft

So the work done in winding 80 ft of the cable on the drum is 640,000 lb-ft.

Now, let's critique the response:

    Incorrect assumption: The response assumes that the height the cable is lifted is half of the length wound on the drum. This may not be accurate, as the height the cable is lifted depends on the radius of the drum and the pitch of the helix formed by the cable. The response does not take into account these factors and assumes a simplified model.

    Missing consideration of the safe weight: The response calculates the work done to lift only the weight of the cable, but does not consider the weight of the safe that is also being lifted. The safe weighs 500 lb, and this weight should be included in the calculation of the total work done.

    Units inconsistency: The response uses lb-ft as the unit for work, which is not a standard unit for work. The correct unit for work is foot-pounds (ft-lb) or joules (J), depending on the system of units used.

    Assumption of constant cable weight: The response assumes that the weight of the cable is constant throughout the winding process, but in reality, the weight of the cable changes as it is wound on the drum, due to the changing radius of the drum. This assumption may not accurately represent the real-world situation.

In conclusion, the response provides a simplified calculation of the work done in winding 80 ft of the cable on a drum, but it makes several assumptions and simplifications that may not accurately represent the real-world situation. A more accurate calculation would require taking into consideration the radius of the drum, the pitch of the helix formed by the cable, the weight of the safe, and the changing weight of the cable as it is wound on the drum. Additionally, using consistent units for the calculation is important.
