Herons Formula and three dimensional pythagoras  theorem. Worked examples with integer values and program code.

Heron's Formula:

Heron's Formula is a formula to calculate the area of a triangle when the length of all three sides is known. The formula is:

Area = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))

where s = (a+b+c)/2 and a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

Here's an example program in Python that implements Heron's Formula:

python

import math

def heron_formula(a, b, c):
    s = (a + b + c) / 2
    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
    return area

# Example usage:
a = 3
b = 4
c = 5
area = heron_formula(a, b, c)
print(f"The area of the triangle with sides {a}, {b}, and {c} is {area}.")

Output:

csharp

The area of the triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5 is 6.0.

Three Dimensional Pythagoras Theorem:

The three-dimensional Pythagoras theorem is a generalization of the Pythagoras theorem in two dimensions. It states that in a right-angled triangle in three dimensions, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

The formula is:

c^2 = a^2 + b^2

Here's an example program in Python that implements the three-dimensional Pythagoras theorem:

python

def three_d_pythagoras(a, b, c):
    if c**2 == a**2 + b**2:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Example usage:
a = 3
b = 4
c = 5
if three_d_pythagoras(a, b, c):
    print(f"The triangle with sides {a}, {b}, and {c} is a right-angled triangle.")
else:
    print(f"The triangle with sides {a}, {b}, and {c} is not a right-angled triangle.")

Output:

csharp

The triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5 is a right-angled triangle.

Note: In the above examples, we have used integer values. However, the formulas work for any positive real numbers.
