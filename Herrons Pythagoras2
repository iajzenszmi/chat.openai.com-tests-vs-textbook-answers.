Herons Formula and Three-Dimensional Pythagorean Theorem: Worked Examples and Program Code

I. Heron's Formula
Heron's formula calculates the area of a triangle when the lengths of all three sides are known. If a triangle has sides a, b, and c, and s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle (i.e., (a + b + c)/2), then the area of the triangle (A) can be found using the formula:

A = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))

    Worked example:

Suppose we have a triangle with sides a = 5, b = 6, and c = 7.
Step 1: Calculate the semi-perimeter, s:
s = (5 + 6 + 7) / 2 = 9

Step 2: Calculate the area using Heron's formula:
A = sqrt(9 * (9 - 5) * (9 - 6) * (9 - 7))
A = sqrt(9 * 4 * 3 * 2)
A = sqrt(216)
A ≈ 14.69694

The area of the triangle is approximately 14.69694 square units.

    Python code implementation:

python

import math

def herons_formula(a, b, c):
    s = (a + b + c) / 2
    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
    return area

a = 5
b = 6
c = 7

area = herons_formula(a, b, c)
print(f"The area of the triangle is approximately {area:.5f} square units.")

II. Three-Dimensional Pythagorean Theorem
The Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions calculates the distance between two points in a three-dimensional space. Given two points P1(x1, y1, z1) and P2(x2, y2, z2), the distance (d) between them can be calculated using the formula:

d = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 + (z2 - z1)^2)

    Worked example:

Suppose we have two points P1(2, 3, 4) and P2(6, 9, 12).
Step 1: Calculate the distance between the points using the three-dimensional Pythagorean theorem:
d = sqrt((6 - 2)^2 + (9 - 3)^2 + (12 - 4)^2)
d = sqrt(4^2 + 6^2 + 8^2)
d = sqrt(16 + 36 + 64)
d = sqrt(116)
d ≈ 10.77033

The distance between the two points is approximately 10.77033 units.

    Python code implementation:

python

import math

def distance_3d(p1, p2):
    x_diff = p2[0] - p1[0]
    y_diff = p2[1] - p1[1]
    z_diff = p2[2] - p1[2]
    distance = math.sqrt(x_diff**2 + y_diff**2 + z_diff**2)
    return distance

p1 = (2, 3, 4)
p2 = (6, 9, 12)

distance = distance_3d(p1, p2)
print(f"The distance between the two points is approximately {distance:.5f} units.")
