critique the following C++ code for elevator simulation: #include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iomanip>

class Elevator {
public:
    Elevator(int max_floor, int capacity) : max_floor(max_floor), capacity(capacity) {}

    void add_request(int from, int to) {
        requests.push_back({from, to});
    }

    void process_requests() {
        sort_requests();
        int current_floor = 1;
        for (const auto& request : requests) {
            int from = request.first;
            int to = request.second;
            travel_time += std::abs(current_floor - from) + std::abs(from - to);
            current_floor = to;

            std::cout << "From floor " << from << " to floor " << to << std::endl;
            std::cout << "Travel time: " << travel_time << std::endl;
        }
    }

private:
    void sort_requests() {
        std::sort(requests.begin(), requests.end());
    }

    int max_floor;
    int capacity;
    int travel_time = 0;
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> requests;
};

int main() {
    Elevator elevator(10, 5);

    elevator.add_request(1, 5);
    elevator.add_request(4, 9);
    elevator.add_request(3, 7);
    elevator.add_request(6, 2);
    elevator.add_request(8, 10);

    std::cout << "Processing elevator requests..." << std::endl;
    elevator.process_requests();

    return 0;
}

The given C++ code simulates an elevator with a given maximum floor and capacity to handle requests to move between different floors. The code appears to be correct and free of errors, but there are some areas that could be improved:

    Error handling: The code does not handle any errors that could occur, such as requests that are out of bounds (less than 1 or greater than max_floor) or requests that exceed the elevator's capacity.

    Encapsulation: The sort_requests function is private, which is good for encapsulation, but the requests vector is public and can be modified from outside the class. This can be problematic because it can result in invalid requests being added to the elevator.

    Code organization: The sort_requests function is defined after the process_requests function, which can be confusing. It is better to define private functions before the public functions that use them.

    Code readability: The code could be made more readable by adding comments to explain what each function does, and by using more descriptive variable names.

    Testing: The code does not have any testing, which could lead to issues if there are any bugs or changes made to the code in the future. It is important to write tests to ensure the code is working as intended.

    Flexibility: The code only handles requests that are added before processing. It may be more useful to have the elevator continuously handle requests as they come in, rather than all at once.

Overall, the code appears to be functional, but there are areas that could be improved to make it more robust and flexible.
